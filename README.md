</p>

**Key Components:**
- **Frontend Web/Mobile:** User interfaces for customers and admins.
- **API Gateway:** Routes REST API requests to the backend.
- **Spring Boot App:** Core backend logic, split into controllers, services, and repositories.
- **Admin Dashboard & Customer App:** Separate modules for different user roles.
- **Services:** Business logic, data access, and external integrations (payment, email).
- **MySQL Database:** Persistent storage for all entities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Java 17, Spring Boot 3
- MySQL, JPA/Hibernate
- Maven

## 📦 Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Configure your database in `src/main/resources/application.properties`
3. Build and run:
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## 📚 Usage

- Access API endpoints at `http://localhost:8080/api/...`
